As you complete project 1, ask yourself:

- Does my site have four pages, including a homepage?
- Do I have a consistent menu and header section on every page?
- Is the length of my content appropriate? Is there new content on every page?
- Does every page have the needed tags at the top of the page (e.g., <head>, etc.)? Check the provided template and make sure.
- Is all of my CSS in one external file? Make sure you're not using style=".." or anything like that.
- Are all of my tags closed? Does each page having closing </body> and </html> tags?
- Are all of my colors expressed as hex codes (e.g., #000000) and not as words (e.g., seafoam)?
- Is the layout of my pages consistent? Have I used the CSS float property to create columns where needed?
- Does my site look and feel like a real site?
- Can my site be accessed by entering my URL into a browser? (I should get to your portfolio by typing www.yourdomain.com -- NOT www.yourdomain.com/portfolio.html or anything like that.)
