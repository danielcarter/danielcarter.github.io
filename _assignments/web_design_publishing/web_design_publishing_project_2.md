For your second project, you'll create a site for an organization. You can pick any organization you want, but you need to have access to people associated with it -- you can already know them or meet them for this project. Think about school organizations (e.g., a show on KTSW), community organizations (e.g., a non-profit or a business) or anything else -- ask me if you're not sure if something will work.  

### Learning Objectives

- Develop skills for working with clients.
- Practice moving from sketches / designs to complete sites.
- Practice using CSS frameworks and creating responsive sites.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you need to do is learn about the organization -- who's involved, what do they care about and who would be interested in their site? Complete the [Rapid User Research activity](/resources/rapid_user_research.html). You'll produce a list of things to keep in mind as you're designing -- __send me your list in a Slack DM.__
2. Keeping in mind what you've learned about the client, sketch several possible designs. Use the methods in the [IDEO Field Guide to Human-Centered Design](/assets/readings/field_guide_to_user_centered_design.pdf) to generate ideas. Think about the advantages of each design and how they reflect the organization's goals. __Send me your sketches in a Slack DM__.
3. Based on your sketches, create a site with at least four pages. Use Bootstrap's CSS framework and make the site responsive.
4. Create a folder inside your /projects folder called project_2. Upload your files to this folder. I should be able to access your site at www.yourdomain.com/projects/project_2/index.html. __Send me a link to your project in a Slack DM__.

### Evaluation

- A+: Site meets all the requirements for an A but also does the following:
  - shows more than minimal time spent learning about the client.
  - includes multiple creative design concepts.
- A: Site meets all requirements and represents the goals of the organization. More than minimal effort has been put in to site design.
- B: Site does not meet all requirements or shows minimal effort in design.
- C: Site is missing pages or is missing several required elements (e.g., does not use Bootstrap or is not responsive).
