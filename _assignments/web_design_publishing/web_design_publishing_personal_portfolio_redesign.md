title: 'Project 4: Personal Portfolio Redesign'
short_title: web_design_publishing_personal_portfolio_redesign

---

For your final project, you'll be redesigning your personal portfolio to reflect what you've learned in the course.

### Learning Objectives

- Apply multimedia narrative skills learned in course.
- Apply web design and development skills learned in course.
- Produce a creative, polished portfolio that reflects your future needs.

### Instructions

1. Think of someone who would be looking at your portfolio. This is often a potential employer, but it could also be someone interested in your art or music or someone who you might want to work with in the future.
2. Design a site that communicates to that person who you are and what you do. Think about what that person values and how you can present yourself in a way that aligns with those values. There are no requirements for number of pages, etc., but the site needs to be fully thought out and should show considerable effort.
3. For this project, you can use any development approaches we have covered in class (e.g., HTML and CSS, Bootstrap, Wordpress, etc.).
4. Your finished project should use a URL that looks good. For example, www.danielcarter.com looks good. So does www.portfolio.danielcarter.com. www.danielcarter.com/school/stuff/project4version27/blah.html is not so good.
5. Post a link to your project on Slack.
