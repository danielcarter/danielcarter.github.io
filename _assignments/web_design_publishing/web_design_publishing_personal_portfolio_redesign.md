title: 'Project 4: Personal Portfolio Redesign'
short_title: web_design_publishing_personal_portfolio_redesign

---

For your final project, you'll be redesigning your personal portfolio to reflect what you've learned in the course.

### Learning Objectives

- Apply multimedia narrative skills learned in course.
- Apply web design and development skills learned in course.
- Produce a portfolio that reflects your future needs.

### Instructions

1. Design a site that communicates who you are and what you do. Start by thinking about:
- What do you have to show? What do you make or do? How can you represent that? Be creative -- this doesn't have to be school assignments.
- How do you want to represent yourself? To who?
- How do you want to manage your site? How often will you want to change it? How much flexibility do you want in the site's appearance?
- What would make you happy?
2. For this project, you can use any development approaches we have covered in class (e.g., HTML and CSS, Bootstrap, Wordpress, etc.).
3. Your finished project should use a URL that looks good. For example, www.danielcarter.com looks good. So does www.portfolio.danielcarter.com. www.danielcarter.com/school/stuff/project4version27/blah.html is not so good.
4. Post a link to your project to #general on Slack.
