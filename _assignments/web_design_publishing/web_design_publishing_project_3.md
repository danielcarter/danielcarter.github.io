### Learning Objectives

- Practice multimedia skills in a journalism context.
- Practice using CSS frameworks and creating responsive sites.
- Practice working with Wordpress.

### Instructions

1. Choose a topic that will work well for a multimedia journalism project. You will be conducting interviews, taking photos and shooting video, so plan accordingly. The project should present original reporting and include multimedia content that you personally produce.
2. Create a Wordpress installation in a subdirectory of your site.
3. Choose a theme for your site.
4. Using the design processes we've learned, produce several designs for your site. Think specifically about how your content will be organized and how users will move between sections.
5. Your site must include:
  - at least four separate pages.
  - at least one video and one slideshow. Extra credit will be given to sites that include additional data elements such as maps or graphs.
  - at least three plugins or widgets.
  - your contact information.
6. Write a 600-word reflection on the project. Include best practices or things that went well, areas for improvement and a reflection on the appropriateness of Wordpress as a CMS for this kind of project. Send me your reflection in a Slack DM.
