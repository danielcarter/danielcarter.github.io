For your second project, you'll create a site for an organization. You can pick any organization you want, but you need to have access to people associated with it -- you can already know them or meet them for this project. Think about school organizations (e.g., a show on KTSW), community organizations (e.g., a non-profit or a business), friends who have a band or anything else -- ask me if you're not sure if something will work.  

### Learning Objectives

- Practice producing multimedia narratives.
- Practice moving from sketches / designs to complete sites.
- Practice using CSS frameworks and creating responsive sites.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you need to do is learn about the organization -- who's involved, what do they care about and who would be interested in their site? Complete the [Rapid User Research activity](/resources/rapid_user_research.html). You'll produce a list of things to keep in mind as you're designing. __Post your list to #organization_site and comment on two others'.__
2. Keeping in mind what you've learned, sketch several possible designs. Think about the advantages of each design and how they reflect the organization's goals and multimedia opportunities. __Send me your sketches in a Slack DM__.
3. Based on your sketches, create a site with at least four pages. Use Bootstrap's CSS framework and make the site responsive.
4. Upload the project to your server and add the project to your personal portfolio. __Post a link to your project in #general__.
