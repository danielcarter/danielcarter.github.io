For your final project, you'll create a site for an organization. You can pick any organization you want, but you need to have access to people associated with it &mdash; you can already know them or meet them for this project. Think about school organizations (e.g., a show on KTSW), community organizations (e.g., a non-profit or a business), friends who have a band or anything else &mdash; ask me if you're not sure if something will work.  

### Learning Objectives

- Practice using multimedia production and web development skills.
- Practice using content management systems.

### Instructions

1. Learn about your organization by talking with them and spending time with them. Find out what they're like, how they like to present themselves, who their audience is and what content would go on their site. You should also think about ways to tell the organization's story - take photos and record video and/or audio.
2. Keeping in mind what you've learned about the organization, sketch several possible designs. Focus your site on telling the organization's story. __Send me your sketches in a Slack DM__.
3. Based on your sketches, create a site with at least four pages. Use Bootstrap's CSS framework and make the site responsive.
4. Upload the project to your server and add the project to your personal portfolio. __Post a link to your project in #general__.
