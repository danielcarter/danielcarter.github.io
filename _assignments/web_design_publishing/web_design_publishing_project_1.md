For your first project, you'll be creating a simple personal site. In Phase 1, you'll code the site in HTML, and in Phase 2 you'll use CSS to style the site.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice writing basic HTML and CSS.
- Practice uploading files to a server.

### Phase 1: HTML

1. Your site needs to include four pages, so start by exploring what those might be. Your site can be about different parts of your life, or it can focus on just one part (your stamp collection, for example). Be creative.
2. Create your site using the basic HTML elements we've learned about in class. Your site should include:
  - a menu with links to all your pages. Use a <ul> for your menu.
  - at least one image.
  - at least one table.
  - at least three links to external sites.
  - your email address, linked using mailto:, like we talked about in class. You can make one of your pages a contact page, or you can choose another way to include this.
3. Validate your HTML using the [w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Fix any errors.
4. On your server, create a folder called projects, and create a folder within that folder called project_1. Upload your four .html files to this folder. The main page of your site should be named index.html. I should be able to access your site at www.yourdomain.com/projects/project_1/index.html. __Send me a link to your project in a Slack DM__.

### Phase 2: CSS

1. Style your site using the basic CSS we learned in class. You might need to revise your HTML in order to create the design you want. Work locally on your personal computer.
2. On your server, create a new folder under /projects called project_1_css. Upload your styled site to this folder. I should be able to access your site at www.yourdomain.com/projects/project_1_css/index.html. __Send me a link to your project in a Slack DM__.

### Evaluation

- A+: Site meets all requirements and includes more than minimal CSS. It doesn't need to be stunning, but you should spend some time playing with different styling options.
- A: Site meets all requirements.
- B: Site does not meet all requirements. HTML does not validate or some required elements missing.
- C: Site is missing pages or is missing several required elements.
