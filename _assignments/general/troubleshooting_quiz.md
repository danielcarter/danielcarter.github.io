The purpose of this quiz is to evaluate your ability to locate and correct HTML and CSS errors. You can use any resources you want during the quiz.

### Instructions

1. Download the files for the quiz. The folder contains several HTML files, a CSS file and several images. It also contains an image named correct.jpg -- this is what your site should look like once you're done.
2. Most of the errors are in the HTML, but a few are in the CSS. These are small errors. You should be correcting things that are wrong (for example, correcting <igm ... /> to <img .../>) -- not writing totally new HTML or CSS.
3. When you're done, your site should look exactly like correct.jpg. You'll also need to verify that all the links work.
4. To turn your quiz in, create a folder on your server called "troubleshooting_quiz." Upload all your files to that folder and check that everything still looks good when you access it on your server (for example, by going to www.yourdomain.com/troubleshooting_quiz/).
5. Send me a Slack DM with a link to your quiz.
