These responses are intended to prepare you for class discussion of assigned readings.

### Instructions

1. After completing the assigned reading, write a 300-word response. The response should be more than a summary; include what you found interesting and what questions you have. If the reading is an example of something you might produce (e.g., a multimedia narrative), think about what you might take from it for your own work. If the reading is about a topic we're talking about in class (e.g., design), think about examples you've run across that are relevant. Try to focus on one or two thoughts and use the response as an opportunity to think through them in depth.
2. Post your response to __#reading_responses__ and read others' responses.
