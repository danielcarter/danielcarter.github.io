These exercises are designed to improve your multimedia skills. Throughout the semester, you will produce multimedia materials such as photographs and video and reflect on your learning process.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice using multimedia production techniques.

### Instructions

1. Choose an event or topic to document using photography and/or video. You might be given additional instructions before completing the exercise.
2. Think about opportunities to collect multimedia documentation of the event or topic. Be creative.
3. After you've collected your multimedia, post a selection to #multimedia on Slack (at least four photos or a short video or two.) You do not need to edit the photos or video for this assignment.
4. With your post, include a reflection on what went well and what could have gone better. What could you have done differently? If you were producing a multimedia narrative, what else would you need. Also include some reflection on what you need to work on (e.g., framing) and how you plan to improve.
