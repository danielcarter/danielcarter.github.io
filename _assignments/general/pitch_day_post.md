This exercise is designed to make sure you're prepared to complete the multimedia profile project and the organization site project. It's important that you get an early start on both projects, and you can save yourself a lot of time by making good plans now. Ideally, you'll work with the same topic for both projects, taking a journalistic perspective in one and a public relations perspective in the other.

### Instructions

1. Write a 200-300 word post explaining your topic for both projects. Include how you plan to get access to the people / organizations as well as opportunities for multimedia content.
2. Post your proposal to **#general**.
