For this project, you'll be conducting user research in preparation for your organization site. We'll use user research to learn about the people who might use the site.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain experience with user research.
- Strengthen existing research skills.

### Instructions

1. Think about what you might need to know about potential users of a site for your chosen organization. You might want to know, for example, how they use the internet or how they think about concepts related to the organization.
2. Choose two or three of the following user research methods, taken from the [IDEO Field Guide to Human-Centered Design](/assets/readings/field_guide_to_user_centered_design.pdf), that will help you answer your questions:
  - Interview (p. 40)
  - Group Interview (p. 42)
  - Immersion (p. 52)
  - Card Sort (p. 57)
  - Collage (p. 61)
  - Guided Tour (p. 64)
3. Conduct your research following IDEO's guidelines. Document your researchâ€”record interviews, make notes and take photographs.
4. Analyze your collected data. What patterns do you notice? What have you learned that helps you answer your questions?
5. Write a 1200- to 1500-word report on your research:
  - Begin with your questions and a description of your chosen methods.
  - Next, include a section titled Findings, in which you describe what you've learned. Present information that you've arrived at through analysis of your data. Connect your findings with evidence from your research: include direct quotes, photographs or details from your notes that support your claims.
  - End your report with a section titled Implications for Design. Describe two to three implications that you will consider as you design the organization site and that result from your research.
