For this project, you'll be conducting user research in preparation for your organization site. User research can help you to understand your clients or the people who will use the site. In this project, we'll focus on user research that happens prior to design, but you might also conduct user research to evaluate a project and revise it.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain experience with user research.
- Strengthen existing research skills.

### Instructions

1. Think about what questions you need to answer in order to design a site for your chosen organization. You might want to know, for example, what kind of content the organization has and how it should be organized or who the intended audience is and what their needs and habits are.
2. Choose two or three of the following user research methods, taken from the [IDEO Field Guide to Human-Centered Design](/assets/readings/field_guide_to_user_centered_design.pdf), that will help you answer your questions:
  - Interview (p. 40)
  - Group Interview (p. 42)
  - Expert Interview (p. 43)
  - Extremes and Mainstreams (p. 49)
  - Immersion (p. 52)
  - Card Sort (p. 57)
  - Collage (p. 61)
  - Guided Tour (p. 64)
3. Conduct your research following IDEO's guidelines. Document your researchâ€”record interviews, make notes and take photographs.
4. Analyze your collected data. What patterns do you notice? What have you learned that helps you answer your questions?
5. Write a 1500-word report on your research:
  - Begin with your questions and a description of your chosen methods.
  - Next, include a section titled Results, in which you describe what you've learned. Connect your results with evidence from your research: include direct quotes, photographs or details from your notes that support your claims.
  - End your report with a section titled Implications for Design. Describe two to three guidelines that you will use as you design the organization site and that result from your research.
