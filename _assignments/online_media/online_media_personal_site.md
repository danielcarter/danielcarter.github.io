### Learning Objectives

- Practice writing basic HTML.

### Instructions

1. Your site needs to include at least three pages. One page should be a portfolio that can eventually include links to your assignments for the course. Include at least one portfolio item to start with.
2. Remix the class's project in Glitch. Add your content and make <strong>significant</strong> changes to the HTML content.  
3. Your site should include:
  - a <ul> for your menu.
  - at least one image.
  - at least one link to an external site.
  - your email address, linked using mailto:, like we talked about in class.
4. Style your site using CSS, following the principles covered in class. You will need to add additional HTML elements and attributes to achieve your desired design. Successful sites will demonstrate the use of layout techniques to create columns and/or grids.
4. Upload your files to your server. The main page of your site should be named index.html. I should be able to access your site at www.yourdomain.com.
