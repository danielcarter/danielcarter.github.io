For your final project, you'll redesign and expand one of your first two projects. If you choose to redesign project 2, you'll work by yourself this time.

This should be a substantial redesign that completely rethinks the original. You might start by thinking either about how the original site could have been better, or you might start by asking yourself how it might work in a very different way. We will discuss strategies for coming up with ideas in class.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice iterating design concepts.
- Practice moving from sketches / designs to complete sites.
- Practice using CSS frameworks and creating responsive sites.

### Instructions

1. First, decide which project you want to redesign. Then, complete the [Iterating Concepts Activity**](). __ Turn it in.
2. Choose a concept to work with and make a plan for developing the site. [Complete the Development Plan Activity**]().

### Evaluation

  - Use of appropriate data visualization.
  - Use of an appropriate content management system.  
- A: Site meets all requirements and represents a substantial rethinking of the original project. More than minimal effort has been put in to site design.
