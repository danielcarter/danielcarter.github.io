Choose a book from the list below and write a 500 to 600-word reflection on it. You don't need to read the entire book, but you should at least closely read the introduction and one chapter that interests you. In your reflection, explore one or more of the following questions:

- Based on what you've read, how would you design and develop web projects differently?
- Did the book make you think about the role of the web designer or web developer differently? How so?
- Was there anything in the book that you disagree with? Why do you disagree?
