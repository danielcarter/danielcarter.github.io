For your second project, you'll work in pairs to create a site for an organization. You can pick any organization you want, but you need to have access to people associated with it -- you can already know them or meet them for this project. Think about school organizations (e.g., a show on KTSW), community organizations (e.g., a non-profit or a business) or anything else -- ask me if you're not sure if something will work.  

### Learning Objectives

- Develop collaboration skills.
- Develop skills for working with clients.
- Practice moving from sketches / designs to complete sites.
- Practice using CSS frameworks and creating responsive sites.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you need to do is learn about the organization -- who's involved, what do they care about and who would be interested in their site? Complete the Client Handout and ____ turn it in with your site ___.
2. Based on the Client Handout, work with your partner to sketch several possible designs. Discuss the advantages of each and how they reflect the organization's goals and values. Turn in your sketches _____.
3. Based on your sketches, create a site with at least four pages. Use Bootstrap's CSS framework, and make the site responsive.
