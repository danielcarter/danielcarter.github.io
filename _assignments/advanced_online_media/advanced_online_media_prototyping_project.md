For your first project, you'll create prototypes (both digital and non-digital) for future projects.

### Learning Objectives

- Produce prototypes in various media and levels of fidelity.
- Practice existing HTML and CSS skills.
- Demonstrate basic understanding of using git.

### Phase 1

1. Reflect on what we've read, what you've seen, what you love and what you hate.
2. Working on paper, sketch ten ideas for projects that align with your interests. These should be small projects. We're not designing entire apps or multimedia packages; we're thinking about small moments of interaction. Examples might include a design for a social media bio or avatar that includes interaction or a way of displaying and interacting with a specific kind of data.
3. Choose two of your ideas to develop further. Create prototypes in any medium except the web (e.g., a series of digital images, a functional paper prototype), post them to __#general__ and be ready to present them in class. Your presentation should walk the class through the prototype and also address why you care, what's interesting about the prototypes and what questions you have going forward.

### Phase 2

1. Choose one of your prototypes to develop into a web project that you'll continue working with for Project 2.
2. Create a non-functioning web prototype. This should be a thoroughly designed version of the project, created using HTML and CSS. The user should be able to see the prototype in context, but only the elements that you're prototyping need to be fully designed. For example, if you're working on an interactive avatar, you would minimally design a page to show how the avatar would be placed on a page, but you would fully design the actual avatar.
3. Upload your project using git and post a link to __#general__. In Project 2, we'll make the prototype interactive.
