For this project, you'll extend one of your earlier projects into a finished portfolio piece.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice existing HTML and CSS skills.
- Practice using git.
- Practice JavaScript techniques for user interaction.
- Practice data visualization techniques.

### Instruction

1. Choose one of your earlier projects to extend. Conceptualize what a complete version of the project might be. For example, if you choose to extend your data project, you might produce additional visualizations and integrate them with journalistic writing to produce a complete story. If you choose to extend your interaction project, you might produce a series of prototypes that explore an idea, or you might produce a complete tool or story with interactive elements.
2. Create your project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
3. Write a 150-word statement on the project, explaining why it is interesting. You should draw on vocabulary adn theory from the semester's readings.
4. Add your project and statement to your portfolio and push your changes to your github repository. __When you're done, post a link to your project in #general__.
