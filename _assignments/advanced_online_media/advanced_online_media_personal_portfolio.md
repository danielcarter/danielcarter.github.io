### Instruction

1. You can design and build your portfolio using any tools and techniques that you like, as long as it's made using HTML and CSS (no CMSs, databases, etc.).
2. Your portfolio needs to include information about you, a way to display projects you've completed and a section for learning journal entries.
3. As you work, push your modifications to your github repository. __When you're done, post a link to your project in #general__.
