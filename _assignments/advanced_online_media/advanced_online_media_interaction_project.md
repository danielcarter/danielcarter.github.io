For this project, you'll produce a prototype that utilizes the interaction techniques covered to this point of the course.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice existing HTML and CSS skills.
- Practice using git.
- Demonstrate JavaScript techniques for user interaction.

### Instruction

1. Extend your work from Project 1 to include appropriate interactions. You should demonstrate techniques learned in class and show significant work refining the prototype's visual design and interactive elements.
2. Write a 150-word statement on the prototype, explaining why it is interesting and how it is in conversation with other examples of interaction design. You might consider, for example, how your design applies existing concepts in an interesting way or how you are using interaction to explore ideas about communication on the web.
3. Add your project and statement to your portfolio and push your changes to your github repository. __When you're done, post a link to your project in #general__.
