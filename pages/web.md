I've worked as a web developer since 2007, both freelance and for companies such as *The Texas Observer*, Enviromedia Social Media Marketing and *The Columbus Dispatch*. In a proud moment, I made the website for Botox for Urinary Incontinence.

I'm primarily interested in working with organizations to understand their current workflows and to design and build online information systems that align with their unique organizational structures and communication needs.

 For fun, I make things like [a digital edition of Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons](./assets/projects/stein/) and [a generative grammar that tries to get you to buy islands](http://www.buyislands.info).
