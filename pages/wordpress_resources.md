Below are themes and plugins that I have tested and found to be useful.

### Themes

- [Primer](https://wordpress.org/themes/primer/) - A solid, minimalist theme.
- [Floral Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/floral-lite/) - A simple magazine or blog theme.
- [Shapely](https://wordpress.org/themes/shapely/) - A theme with more features (that requires more time to learn). Note: not all Shapely features play well with the Page Builder plugin below.

### Plugins

- [WP Google Maps](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-maps/) - Easily add customizable Google Maps to your site.
- [Page Builder by SiteOrigin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/) - Create flexible page layouts. Note: does not work well with some other plugins.
- [MasterSlider](https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-slider/) - An easy-to-use image slider.
- [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) - Easily disable and hide comments.
