I'm an assistant professor of digital media in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Texas State University. I study how sociotechnical systems collect, analyze, make available and obscure data, specifically in relation to labor and the monetization of personal communication. I'm interested in the constraints systems place on what can be known and said, as well as the literacy required to use technologies in creative ways that align with diverse values.
