I'm an assistant professor of digital media in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Texas State University. I study how people use and adapt technologies in order to meet their distinct needs and to imagine preferred futures. By studying groups such as data scientists and digital humanities scholars, I hope to better understand how we can support diverse practices now and creatively shape technology use in the future. I have side interests in digital humanities, data visualization, labor and infrastructure.
