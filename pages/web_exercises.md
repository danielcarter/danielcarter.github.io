Each exercise includes an index.html file and a solution.html file. The goal of these exercises is to make your index.html file appear, in a browser, the same as the solution.html file.

### CSS

For these exercises, you'll be editing main.css to make index.html appear the same as solution.html.

- Text Formatting: [Download]({{site.url}}/exercises/css/text_formatting.zip) or [View Solution]({{site.url}}/exercises/css/text_formatting/solution.html)

### Bootstrap

For these exercises, you'll be editing index.html and main.css to make index.html appear the same as solution.html. You will need to write HTML markup using Bootstrap classes and components and might also need to write custom CSS in main.css.

- Responsive Bios: [Download]({{site.url}}/exercises/bootstrap/responsive_bios.zip) or [View Solution]({{site.url}}/exercises/bootstrap/responsive_bios/solution.html)
