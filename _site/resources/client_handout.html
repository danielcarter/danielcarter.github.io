      <h2>Client Handout</h2>
    
  

  <p>This handout will help you gather information from a client before beginning design and development work. “Client” here just means the person or organization that you’re developing a project for. If you work for a marketing agency, for example, your client would be the organization you’re working on a campaign for. A client can also be the organization that you’re part of – you might be in the IT department working on a project for the PR department, for example.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-gather-information">How to Gather Information</h3>

<p>You can gather information from a client in a number of ways, but in general it’s best to spend a little time getting to know them. Some things you might consider doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visit the client’s location. If it’s an organization, ask for a tour of their offices. Listen to what they tell you – but also look around and take notes. What kind of people are there? Is it a casual place or a formal place? What are people wearing?</li>
  <li>Interview the client – you might do this in person or over the phone, but email can be a last resort. If the client is an organization, try to talk with someone who has been there a long time or who knows a lot about the project you’re working on. A list of questions to ask clients is below.</li>
  <li>Review other materials the client has produced. These might include websites, videos or even internal documents about the history, culture or goals of the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions-to-answer">Questions to Answer</h3>

<p>As you’re gathering information, try to answer the following questions. If you’re turning this in with an assignment, provide short a short paragraph for each question.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What does the organization do? Who are its clients – who does it sell to, communicate with or help?</li>
  <li>How does the organization represent itself? Is it professional? Casual? What tone does it use?</li>
  <li>Who in the organization is important in making decisions? As a designer, who would you need to convince? What’s most important to that person?</li>
</ul>
