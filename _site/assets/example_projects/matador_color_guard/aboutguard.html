              <h1>Color Guard</h1>
              <h2>Summer and Fall</h2>
              <p>Color guard is a performing art involving dance and "spinning" equipment. Most commonly, color guards utilize flags, rifles and sabres, which date back to the military use of color guards throughout history. Fast forward a few centuries, and color guard has evolved into an exhibiton of expressionism that employs color, dance ranging from ballet to jazz to modern and interpretive, and even theatrical performance to tell a story with the marching band. Color guards accompany the drumline and marching band during their shows at football halftimes and weekend marching band contests held throughout the fall. "Marching season" begins in mid-May, when professional-style drum and bugle corps tour the country with their respective color guards. High schools in Texas begin in late July and perform throughout the fall semester.</p>

              <h2>Winter and Spring</h2>
              <p>Winterguard is where guard members get the spotlight. The activity moves indoors, usually in basketball gymnasiums, and uses a recorded backtrack or song as the music instead of a live marching band. Dance and equpiment are accompanied by "floors" or "tarps," which are designed for each specific show and help express the show's theme. Auditions are held toward the end of the fall semester, and rehearsals and contests run from January to April, culminating in the Winterguard International World Championships in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
