<p>This course introduces students to advanced web development topics related to interaction and data, with an emphasis on their relevance to online storytelling. In addition to covering technical topics such as JavaScript, data visualization and version control, we’ll read work from fields like interaction design and human-computer interaction to help us ask questions around the production of interactive, multimedia narratives.</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>

<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss the use of interactive elements and data in online communication.</li>
  <li>describe basic computer programming techniques.</li>
  <li>produce web elements that incorporate data and interactivity.</li>
  <li>produce narratives that apply course skills.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-organization">Course Organization</h3>

<p>This course involves learning technical skills and also developing ways of thinking about design and communication. Classes will be split between workshop time – when we learn by doing and work together to create web projects – and discussions of readings and relevant topics. You should expect to spend several hours each week reading, working on projects and completing other assignments.</p>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>Many resources are available to you online, and we’ll talk in class about how to find good resources. Additional assistance is available during designated times in the Media Innovation Lab. You can also come to my office hours or email me.</p>

<p>If you have questions that might be of interest to everyone or want to discuss anything related to class, post them to the #questions channel on  <a href="http://mc5317spring2019.slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

<p>Unless you have received an extension, assignments turned in late will have five points deducted per day. Work turned in over five days late will not be graded.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>You must use an active Texas State email account. Communication via TRACS uses your Texas State email, and the university is required to send grade information out only through the Texas State email system. Make sure you check your email on a regular basis, as schedule changes will be communicated there as well as on TRACS.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The School of Journalism and Mass Communication takes your education seriously. Therefore, to do this class properly, the School demands the highest standard of academic honesty and integrity from you. Violations of academic honesty, including but not limited to colluding with other students (without permission) on assignments or exams, can lead to severe penalties. Disciplinary actions are outlined in the Texas State Academic Honesty Statement, which can be found in the <a href="http://www.dos.txstate.edu/handbook.html">Texas State University student handbook</a>.</p>
