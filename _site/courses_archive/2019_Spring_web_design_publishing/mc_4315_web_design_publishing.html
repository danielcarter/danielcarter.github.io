<p>This course involves learning technical skills and also developing ways of thinking about web design and publishing. Classes will be split between workshop time – when we learn by doing and work together to create web projects – and discussions of readings and relevant topics. You should expect to spend several hours each week reading, working on projects and completing other assignments.</p>
