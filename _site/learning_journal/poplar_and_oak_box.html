  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Practice making miter joints.</li>
  <li>Make a nicer piece designed to fit on top of a cabinet and hold important items.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>

<p>I wanted to make a very low, very minimal box that would sit on top of a blue metal cabinet I have. I planned to have two drawers that could hold important papers and other things that I want to store in a special place. The height of the box was constrained by a picture hung above the cabinet. I chose to use poplar, because I wanted to work with a hardwood, and I actually like the color.</p>

<p>My original plan was to use splined miter joints and highlight the wrapping of the wood grain around the box. However, my miter joints, which I cut on the table saw, were off, so I decided to just use rabbet joints in order to preserve as much height and width as I could. These came out fine, but I think the miter joints would have really been nice.</p>

<h3 id="things-that-went-well">Things that went well</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I’m very happy with the dimensions and the overall design.</li>
  <li>This was my first time making drawers, and they fit well (after some adjusting…).</li>
  <li>I’m happy with the finish: two coats of tung oil and two light coats of polyurethane. I might go with one more coat of polyurethane next time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-that-didnt-go-well">Things that didn’t go well</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I have to get better at miter joints or stop trying them. I’m going to make a larger workbench and mount the saws into it to see if that helps.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>

<p>This was the first piece I really put money into materials for, and overall I’m happy. It feels really solid, and I think it will last a long time.</p>
