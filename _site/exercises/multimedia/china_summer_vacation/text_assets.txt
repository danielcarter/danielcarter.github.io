August is the hottest month in Chongqing, a municipality located roughly 700 miles from the ocean. Last month the temperature peaked at about 106 degrees — some 15 degrees higher than the average temperature for the same day in previous years — which suggests why the city is known as one of China’s “three great furnaces.” The humidity, which often reaches 80 percent, helps explain its designation as “the fog capital.” For almost a decade, Chongqing’s economy has been one of the fastest growing among China’s major municipalities. The closest respite for local families is a 16-acre Caribbean- and Mayan-themed water park, built on Nashan Mountain. On a summer day, more than 13,000 day-trippers and vacationers from Chengdu to Guang’an might visit the attraction, most of which is underwater or within the range of hoses and sprinklers. Picnic tables are built into shallow pools for games of Chinese chess and mah-jongg; musical acts perform on the water stage. The most popular spot is a wave pool that produces eight different kinds of swells. Deng Xingkai, who is 32 and owns a hot-pot restaurant in Chongqing, describes the wave pool as like swimming in a real ocean — and the best chance for a family outing. “My child rarely gets a chance to go on a vacation with us,” he says. “We are too busy with the restaurant business. We don’t have weekends, and we have to work on public holidays too. But you have to make a living, right?”
