  <p>This course is designed to instruct students in Web site construction and design. Students will learn Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) coding and be introduced to graphics and multimedia programs, web development frameworks and content management systems. The course will address user-centered design, graphics and multimedia on Web sites for journalism, advertising, public relations and other communication related applications. Students will work on several small Web projects that will lead to a final multimedia project. The goal is to emphasize more than just the skills associated with individual programs, but the integration of several programs and concepts into creating well designed and effective Web sites.</p>

<p>In addition, the class will address the history and social implications of creating for the web, including developing for diversity and inclusiveness.</p>

<p>The course requires attendance at lab sessions and lectures as topics tend to build upon one another. In past semesters, students who attended class regularly turned in the more creative, impressive projects.</p>

<!--
This course introduces students to web design and development. In addition to gaining skills in HTML and CSS, students will analyze examples of online storytelling and will think about web design and development in the context of social issues such as access and diversity.
-->
<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS and other design technologies in digital storytelling</li>
  <li>critique examples of online storytelling</li>
  <li>explain the role of interactive, multimedia storytelling, including issues of diversity and inclusiveness</li>
  <li>develop functional sites that demonstrate user-centered design concepts using current frameworks and content management systems</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>

<p>Based on class voting, I’ll add one point to the final grade of the student who has the best pitch day presentation and multimedia check-in.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>

<p>Each absence in addition to two will result in a loss of 10% of the attendance portion of your grade.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

<p>You may turn in one assignment late during the semester, if you make prior arrangements. Any other late assignments will receive a grade of F</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>You must use an active Texas State email account. Communication via TRACS uses your Texas State email, and the university is required to send grade information out only through the Texas State email system. Make sure you check your email on a regular basis, as schedule changes will be communicated there as well as on TRACS.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The School of Journalism and Mass Communication takes your education seriously. Therefore, to do this class properly, the School demands the highest standard of academic honesty and integrity from you. Violations of academic honesty, including but not limited to colluding with other students (without permission) on assignments or exams, can lead to severe penalties. Disciplinary actions are outlined in the Texas State Academic Honesty Statement, which can be found in the <a href="http://www.dos.txstate.edu/handbook.html">Texas State University student handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Other references: <a href="http://www.dos.txstate.edu/handbook/rules/cosc.html">Code of Student Conduct</a> and <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/honorcodecouncil/Academic-Integrity.html">The Honor Code</a></p>

<h3 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h3>

<p>If you are a student with a disability certified by the Texas State University Office of Disability Services, and you require accommodations for that disability in class, please tell me early in the semester so that I can accommodate you properly.</p>
