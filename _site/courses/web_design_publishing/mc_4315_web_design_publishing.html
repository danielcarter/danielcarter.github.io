  <p>This course introduces students to web design and development. In addition to gaining skills in HTML and CSS, students will analyze examples of online storytelling and will think about web design and development in the context of social issues such as access and diversity.</p>

<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design and develop projects in HTML and CSS, as well as using current frameworks and content management systems.</li>
  <li>critique examples of online storytelling.</li>
  <li>produce online, multimedia packages.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-organization">Course Organization</h3>

<p>This course involves learning technical skills and also developing ways of thinking about web design and publishing. Classes will be split between workshop time – when we learn by doing and work together to create web projects – and discussions of readings and relevant topics. You should expect to spend several hours each week reading, working on projects and completing other assignments.</p>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>Many resources are available to you online, and we’ll talk in class about how to find good resources. Additional assistance is available during designated times in the Media Innovation Lab. You can also come to my office hours or email me.</p>

<p>If you have questions that might be of interest to everyone or want to discuss anything related to class, post them to the #questions channel on  <a href="https://mc4315spring2018.slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>

<p>Each unexcused absence in addition to five will result in two points off your final grade.</p>

<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>

<p>If the class is active on Slack and uses it to ask questions and get help, I’ll add two points to the final grade of the student who’s voted most helpful at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>The student who has the best proposal on pitch day will also receive an extra one point on their final grade.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

<p>Unless you have received an extension, assignments turned in late will have five points deducted per day. Work turned in over five days late will not be graded.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>You must use an active Texas State email account. Communication via TRACS uses your Texas State email, and the university is required to send grade information out only through the Texas State email system. Make sure you check your email on a regular basis, as schedule changes will be communicated there as well as on TRACS.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The School of Journalism and Mass Communication takes your graduate education seriously. Therefore, to do this class properly, the School demands the highest standard of academic honesty and integrity from you. Violations of academic honesty, including but not limited to colluding with other students (without permission) on assignments or exams, can lead to severe penalties. Disciplinary actions are outlined in the Texas State Academic Honesty Statement, which can be found in the <a href="http://www.dos.txstate.edu/handbook.html">Texas State University student handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Other references: <a href="http://www.dos.txstate.edu/handbook/rules/cosc.html">Code of Student Conduct</a> and <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/honorcodecouncil/Academic-Integrity.html">The Honor Code</a></p>

<h3 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h3>

<p>If you are a student with a disability certified by the Texas State University Office of Disability Services, and you require accommodations for that disability in class, please tell me early in the semester so that I can accommodate you properly.</p>
