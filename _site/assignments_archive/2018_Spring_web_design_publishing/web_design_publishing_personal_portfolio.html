<p>For your first project, you’ll be creating a simple personal portfolio that communicates who you are and what you do. In Phase 1, you’ll code the site in HTML, and in Phase 2 you’ll use CSS to style the site.</p>

<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Practice writing basic HTML and CSS.</li>
  <li>Practice uploading files to a server.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="phase-1-html">Phase 1: HTML</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Your site needs to include at least four pages: a homepage that tells a little about you and links to projects you’ve worked on; at least two pages giving details about projects; and a page that tells more about you and provides your contact information.</li>
  <li>Create your site using the basic HTML elements we’ve learned about in class. Your site should include:
    <ul>
      <li>a &lt;ul&gt; for your menu.</li>
      <li>at least one image.</li>
      <li>at least one link to an external site.</li>
      <li>your email address, linked using mailto:, like we talked about in class. You can make one of your pages a contact page, or you can choose another way to include this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Upload your files to your server. The main page of your site should be named index.html. I should be able to access your site at www.yourdomain.com. <strong>Send me a link to your project in a Slack DM</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="phase-2-css">Phase 2: CSS</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Style your site using the basic CSS we learned in class. You might need to revise your HTML in order to create the design you want. Work locally on your personal computer.</li>
  <li>On your server, create a new folder under /projects called project_1_css. Upload your styled site to this folder. I should be able to access your site at www.yourdomain.com. <strong>Send me a link to your project in a Slack DM</strong>.</li>
</ol>
