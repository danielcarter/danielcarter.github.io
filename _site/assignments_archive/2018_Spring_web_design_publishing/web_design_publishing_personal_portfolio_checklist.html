<p>As you complete project 1, ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does my site have four pages, including a homepage?</li>
  <li>Do I have a consistent menu and header section on every page?</li>
  <li>Is the length of my content appropriate? Is there new content on every page?</li>
  <li>Does every page have the needed tags at the top of the page (e.g., &lt;head&gt;, etc.)? Check the provided template and make sure.</li>
  <li>Is all of my CSS in one external file? Make sure you’re not using style=”..” or anything like that.</li>
  <li>Are all of my tags closed? Does each page having closing &lt;/body&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; tags?</li>
  <li>Are all of my colors expressed as hex codes (e.g., #000000) and not as words (e.g., seafoam)?</li>
  <li>Is the layout of my pages consistent? Have I used the CSS float property to create columns where needed?</li>
  <li>Does my site look and feel like a real site?</li>
  <li>Can my site be accessed by entering my URL into a browser? (I should get to your portfolio by typing www.yourdomain.com – NOT www.yourdomain.com/portfolio.html or anything like that.)</li>
</ul>
