<p>For your second project, you’ll create a site for an organization. You can pick any organization you want, but you need to have access to people associated with it – you can already know them or meet them for this project. Think about school organizations (e.g., a show on KTSW), community organizations (e.g., a non-profit or a business), friends who have a band or anything else – ask me if you’re not sure if something will work.</p>
