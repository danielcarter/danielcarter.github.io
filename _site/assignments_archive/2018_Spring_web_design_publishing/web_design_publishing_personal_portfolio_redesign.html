<p>For your final project, you’ll be redesigning your personal portfolio to reflect what you’ve learned in the course.</p>

<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Apply multimedia narrative skills learned in course.</li>
  <li>Apply web design and development skills learned in course.</li>
  <li>Produce a portfolio that reflects your future needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Design a site that communicates who you are and what you do. Start by thinking about:
    <ul>
      <li>What do you have to show? What do you make or do? How can you represent that? Be creative – this doesn’t have to be school assignments.</li>
      <li>How do you want to represent yourself? To who?</li>
      <li>How do you want to manage your site? How often will you want to change it? How much flexibility do you want in the site’s appearance?</li>
      <li>What would make you happy?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For this project, you can use any development approaches we have covered in class (e.g., HTML and CSS, Bootstrap, Wordpress, etc.).</li>
  <li>Your finished project should use a URL that looks good. For example, www.danielcarter.com looks good. So does www.portfolio.danielcarter.com. www.danielcarter.com/school/stuff/project4version27/blah.html is not so good.</li>
  <li>Post a link to your project to #general on Slack.</li>
</ol>
