Main point: The design process is not about you or making you look good. It's about producing something that meets the needs of your client / community.

These are methods that you can use for web design but also for lots of other kinds of projects. They're relevant in marketing, advertising, PR, etc.

Ask: How is this different from academic research?

#### Notes on research methods from IDEO Field Guide

##### Interview
  - Record and take notes. Focus on what they say, not what you hear.
  - Conduct the interview in their space; take photos.
  - Ask open-ended questions. Follow up. Don't lead.
  - Who should you be interviewing?
  - What kinds of questions would you want to ask?

##### Group Interview
  - Good way to get at shared values.
  - Can be smaller groups -- three or four.
  - Get people involved. "What do you think?"

##### Expert Interview
  - Good way to gather history, context.
  - Who are relevant experts for you?

##### Immersion
  - Could also just be hanging out in the space.

##### Card Sort
  - Used to either rank importance or to organize information.
  - Who would you do card sorts with? What would be on the cards?

##### Drawing
  - Don't have them draw the website. Have them draw how they decide to ______.
