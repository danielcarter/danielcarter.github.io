title: Introduction to HTML
---

### Learning Objectives:

- gain a conceptual understanding of markup languages
- learn basic html tags
- practice uploading files to a server using FTP

### Lesson Plans

- Introduce concept of structure. Walk through a few examples and have them describe the structure.
- Download the basic site template, talk about good project workflow and walk through basic tags. (If one-day course, walk through all tags.) Include some weird things:
	- image in a link
	- different elements in a list, in a table

If two-day course, break here.

- Talk about semantics, HTML5 elements
	- If time, look at accessibility with a screen reader
- Have them code a few examples. (e.g., Yelp results list)
- FTP practice
