### Learning Objectives:

- understand design as a process of exploration
- learn some basic design principles
- practice moving from sketches to code

### Lesson Plans

#### Day 1

- We're going to design a new newspaper homepage. Start by having them just draw a design for 5 or 10 minutes. Does anyone think their design is the best? Why?
- Talk about possibilities -- we want to put a lot out on the table and then think about what's best. A lot of times this starts with "What if?"
- Design the homepage again. This time, they have to sketch a new design every 3 minutes. If they have an idea, they can try it out -- otherwise, give them the following What Ifs:
	- What if the focus was only on one story?
	- What if you prioritize images?
	- What if you prioritize video?
	- What if the users are all on smartphones?
	- What if the users are all on feature phones?
	- What if the users all use smart watches?
	- What if you don't use headlines?
	- What if the focus is on the authors?
- Look at examples of spectacular failure.
- Look at examples that students think might work really well. Talk about them.
- If there's time, have people iterate and refine an example they particularly like.
- Talk about what might come next: prototyping, user testing.

#### Day 2

- Design principles.


#### In-Class Design Project (Days 3 and 4)

- Work in two to three groups. Each group will design a web site that communicates a (provided) message. Groups will receive some user research and will go through a series of activities to generate multiple designs.
