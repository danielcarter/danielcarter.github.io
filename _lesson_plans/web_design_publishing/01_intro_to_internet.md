### Lesson Plans

(If splitting over two days, break after talking about documentary.)

- Intros
- Go over syllabus
- Talk about documentary ...
	- Is it really democratic? Does everyone have their "little piece of power"? Do we have broadcast towers? What do you actually watch on Youtube?
	- Are there really no more gatekeepers? So, the Washington Post is irrelevant now?
	- How do people get music now?
	- To what extent is this two-way communication? Are youtube stars really that different than networks?
	- Anybody ever started a blog? How many people read it?
	- If you're so excited about working for a newspaper, why are you so excited about Facebook? How do we feel about falling nytimes profits?
	- What's the difference between Facebook and Wikipedia? Do we have enough rules to "discourage bad things"?
	- What can't you say? Where?
	- Has the web turned out to be something that "big business can never hope to control" or the "medium of the little guy"?


	- What is "web-enabled people power"?
	- Do we talk about Facebook the same way now? Is MZ still a "kid"?
	- Also, CL is still around...
	- What choices did we used to make? What do we make now? Who will make choices in the future?
	- Who will need to code in the future?
	- "a service that captures the totality of human relationships"
	- How do you feel about this idea of dominos falling? Are we really just watching something that's bound to happen?

- Slides talking about internet and changing ways of communicating.
- Can leave off demographic bits if need more time.
- Activity: Have students stand in for different parts of network:
	- browser
	- DNS server
	- web server
	- HTML page (start with index.html, go to another one)
	- FTP client
- Talk about FTP clients and text editors
	- Open their webspace
	- create an html file (not index.html -- talk about why nothing comes up)
	- create an index.html file
	- create a folder
