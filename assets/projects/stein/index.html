The magazine’s staff responded that this would indeed be elegant, but they were unsure how it would be eaten.</p>

                    <p>"When gourmandise becomes gluttony, voracity or debauchery, it loses its name and attributes, falling into the hands of the moralist who will treat it by advice, or the medical man who will treat it by remedy. Gourmandise, as the professor has described it, has a name only in French; neither the Latin gula, English 'gluttony' nor German lusternheit, expresses it, and we recommend all who attempt a translation of this instructive book to preserve the word, changing the article which produces it only." &mdash; Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin</p>

                    <p>"The best foreign cooking is in the homes of the French who have been forced for one reason or another to live in their colonies. Even Italian dishes are rarely well prepared by the French. As for American dishes, they are scarcely recognisable. But after two or three years in Indo-China or Africa, they return not only with the recipes of the local cooking but with the materials unobtainable in France and a knowledge of how to prepare them." &mdash; Alice B.

                    <p>I've always thought this section was funny, although I doubt many others do. David Burke, the chef at Townhouse in New York, I think might. For at least the past few years, he has had on his menu a dish called Duck Duck Duck. At one point it consisted of a seared breast, a foie gras dumpling and a confit thigh, but it seems that the thigh has at some point been replaced by a meatloaf. Apparently Duck Duck Duck may be many different things&mdash;and to many different people, as Masaharu Morimoto (of <em>Iron Chef</em> fame) includes on his menu a dish of the same name. His version includes a Peking duck leg, a soft duck egg and a duck sandwich on a <a href="#" id="morimoto-croissant">foie gras croissant</a>. <em>New York</em> magazine called Morimoto's dish "an inspired postmodern dissertation."</p>

                    <p>Complications proliferate. Burke has accused Morimoto of stealing his dish, and Morimoto, at his Napa restaurant, offers a dish called Duck Duck Goose that introduces gooseberries to the mix.</p>
