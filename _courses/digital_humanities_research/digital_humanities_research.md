This five-day course will introduce graduate students to techniques for analyzing humanities data, with a focus on textual data. Topics will include feature extraction, exploratory analysis and data visualization, as well as a basic introduction to machine learning techniques such as topic modeling and support vector machine classifiers. No prior technical knowledge is needed for the course – while students will gain basic programming skills in R, the course’s emphasis will be on developing a conceptual understanding of techniques in order to think about how they might be used in future work. Along with the reading of core digital humanities texts, this technical understanding will be used to ground discussions of questions that are central to digital humanities work such as how aggregate quantitative data can be used to understand situated cultural objects.

### Day 1: Introduction: Representing Text with Numbers

We'll begin learning about text analysis by covering different ways that texts get represented with numbers. We'll cover basic concepts like document-term matrices and start using visualization for exploratory analysis.

### Day 2: Supervised Techniques: Support Vector Machines

We'll continue learning about text analysis by introducing supervised techniques -- techniques that allow the researcher to guide large-scale analysis. Working in groups, we'll classify sample texts and then train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to search for similar texts in a larger collection. We'll continue to use visualization techniques to explore our results.

### Day 3: Unsupervised Techniques: Topic Models

This class will focus on unsupervised technique, using topic models as our example. Unlike supervised techniques, unsupervised techniques do not allow the researcher to guide analysis. We'll work with the same collection of texts and begin discussing how the results we've produced might be useful in our work.

### Day 4: Reflections

We'll step back from learning about text analysis and consider debates about these techniques' role in humanities work. Drawing on arguments by Lev Manovich and others, we'll consider discuss what makes us excited, what makes us hesitant, and we'll begin talking about how we might (or might not) use text analysis and similar forms of computational analysis in our work.

### Day 5: Project Day

Working in groups, we'll develop ideas for projects using the techniques we've learned about (or others). Groups might plan how they would gather and analyze data, or they might sketch visualizations or interfaces that would support their work.
