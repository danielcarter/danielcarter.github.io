---

### Learning Objectives:

- understand internet access and usage in relation to demographics
- understand how servers process and transmit information
- understand file formats
- begin working in a text editor

### Lesson Plans

#### Day 1

- Present a history of the internet, specifically related to publishing and communication. Talk about centralization and platforms.
- Trace a story across different platforms. What skills / people are needed to make it appear there?
- Discuss Pew Research Center Fact Sheets. Have students read and discuss in small groups, then as a class ask what they found interesting. Talk about how different messages might need to be created in different ways to reach different groups. Have them throttle the internet to 2g and go to sites they frequent. (What if we voted using smartphones? What if important news was only available using broadband?)

#### Day 2
