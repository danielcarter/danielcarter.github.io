[Full Schedule](/courses/web_design_publishing/mc_4315_web_design_publishing_schedule_fall2017.html)

This course introduces students to web design and development. In addition to gaining skills in HTML and CSS, students will learn principles of user-centered design and will think about web design and development in the context of social issues such as diversity and inclusion.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- design projects based on principles of user-centered design.
- develop projects in HTML and CSS, as well as using current frameworks and content management systems.
- evaluate user experience.
- discuss the role of web design and development in relation to current social issues.

### Course Organization

This course involves learning technical skills and also developing perspectives on web publishing. Classes will be split between workshop time -- when we learn by doing and work together to create web projects -- and discussions of readings and relevant topics.

### Evaluation



### Communication

You must use an active Texas State email account. Communication via TRACS uses your Texas State email, and the university is required to send grade information out only through the Texas State email system. Make sure you check your email on a regular basis, as schedule changes will be communicated there as well as on TRACS.
