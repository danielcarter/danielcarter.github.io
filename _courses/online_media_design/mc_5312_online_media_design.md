This course introduces students to web design and development. In addition to gaining skills in HTML and CSS, students will learn principles of user-centered design and user research and will think about web design and development in the context of social issues such as access and diversity.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- design and develop projects in HTML and CSS, as well as using current frameworks and content management systems.
- conduct user research.
- use human-centered design methods.
- think creatively about web publishing.

### Course Organization

This course involves learning technical skills and also developing ways of thinking about web design and publishing. Classes will be split between workshop time -- when we learn by doing and work together to create web projects -- and discussions of readings and relevant topics. While the course requires minimal reading, you should expect to spend several hours each working on projects and completing required tutorials.

### Getting Help

Many resources are available to you online, and we'll talk in class about how to find good resources. Additional assistance is available during designated times in the Media Innovation Lab. You can also come to my office hours or email me.

If you have questions that might be of interest to everyone or want to discuss anything related to class, post them to the #questions channel on  [Slack](https://mc5312fall2017.slack.com).

### Extra Credit

If the class is active on Slack and uses it to ask questions and get help, I'll add two points to the final grade of the student who's voted most helpful at the end of the semester.

### Late Work

Unless you have received an extension, assignments turned in late will have five points deducted per day. Work turned in over a week late will not be graded.

### Communication

You must use an active Texas State email account. Communication via TRACS uses your Texas State email, and the university is required to send grade information out only through the Texas State email system. Make sure you check your email on a regular basis, as schedule changes will be communicated there as well as on TRACS.
