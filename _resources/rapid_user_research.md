This activity will help you gather information before beginning design work.

### How to Gather Information

1. Think about who will use the object you're designing. If it's a website, who would visit it?
2. Find some of these people. They don't have to be the exact people who would use the site, but they should be like them. For example, if you're making a website intended for the fans of a band, find people that are the same age as those fans and who maybe like similar kinds of music. On the other hand, if the purpose of the site is to get the band a label, you would want to find people who work at music labels and make those kinds of decisions.
3. Conduct informal interviews with two or three of these people. Your goal is to find out what kind of information they need and when they need it:
	- *What kind of information they need:* Ask questions like "What do you look for when you go to a ____ site?" You might have them look at a similar site (e.g., a similar band's site) and talk about what's there -- is it what they want to see? What else would they want to see? Your goal is to get an idea of the content your site should have and how it should be organized. You might also look at a lot of similar sites and make a list of all the kinds of content they have -- show that list to people and ask what they would want to see and what's most important to them.
	- *When do they need information:* It's also important to know when they need this information. Are they bored at home or are they in a hurry and looking things up in their car? In the first case, you're designing primarily for desktop and will want to focus on different information. In the second case, you're designing primarily for mobile and will want to make everything very quick.
4. Document as much of your research as you can. Take pictures, record interviews and take notes. When you're done, make a list of things that you need to think about when designing your site. These could be things like "The main purpose of the site is to provide information about upcoming shows" or "Most users will likely be on mobile."
