title: Client Handout
---

This handout will help you gather information from a client before beginning design and development work. "Client" here just means the person or organization that you're developing a project for. If you work for a marketing agency, for example, your client would be the organization you're working on a campaign for. A client can also be the organization that you're part of -- you might be in the IT department working on a project for the PR department, for example.

### How to Gather Information

You can gather information from a client in a number of ways, but in general it's best to spend a little time getting to know them. Some things you might consider doing:

- Visit the client's location. If it's an organization, ask for a tour of their offices. Listen to what they tell you -- but also look around and take notes. What kind of people are there? Is it a casual place or a formal place? What are people wearing?
- Interview the client -- you might do this in person or over the phone, but email can be a last resort. If the client is an organization, try to talk with someone who has been there a long time or who knows a lot about the project you're working on. A list of questions to ask clients is below.
- Review other materials the client has produced. These might include websites, videos or even internal documents about the history, culture or goals of the organization.

### Questions to Answer

As you're gathering information, try to answer the following questions. If you're turning this in with an assignment, provide short a short paragraph for each question.

- What does the organization do? Who are its clients -- who does it sell to, communicate with or help?
- How does the organization represent itself? Is it professional? Casual? What tone does it use?
- Who in the organization is important in making decisions? As a designer, who would you need to convince? What's most important to that person?
