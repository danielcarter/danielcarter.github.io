title: Client Handout
---

This handout will help you gather information from a client before beginning design and development work. "Client" here just means the person or organization that you're developing a project for. If you work for a marketing agency, for example, your client would be the organization you're working on a campaign for. A client can also be internal to an organization that you're part of -- you might be in the IT department working on a project for the PR department, for example.

### How to Gather Information

You can gather information from a client in a number of ways, but in general it's best to get as close as you can and spend as much time as possible getting to know them. Some things you might consider doing:

- Visit the client's location. If it's an organization, ask for a tour of their offices. Listen to what they tell you -- but also look around and take notes. What kind of people are there? Is it a casual place or a formal place? What are people wearing?
- Interview the client -- you might do this in person or over the phone, but email can be a last resort. If the client is an organization, try to talk with someone who has been there a long time or who has knowledge of the project you're working on. A list of questions to ask clients is below.
- Review other materials the client has produced. These might include websites, videos or even internal documents about the history, culture or goals of the organization.

### Questions to Answer

As you're gathering information, try to answer the following questions. If you're turning this in with an assignment, answer each of the following questions in one to two paragraphs.
