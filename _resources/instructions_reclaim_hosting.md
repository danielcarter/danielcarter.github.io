1. Go to [reclaimhosting.com](http://www.reclaimhosting.com).
2. Click Sign Up.
3. Choose the Student / Individual plan.
4. Choose a domain name. You can pick anything you want, but most people choose something related to their name so that they can use the domain for their personal site after the class ends.
5. Choose whether you want your contact information to be public. I recommend choosing to not make it public. (Check the box for ID protection.)
6. Fill out the payment form. This should cost about $30 / year.
