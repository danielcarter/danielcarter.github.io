title: Major Redesign Activity
---

This activity will help you come up with ideas for a major redesign. By major redesign, I mean more than just changing how a site looks -- this activity will help you imagine new ways that the site might work. Each of the following activities will result in new sketches -- do each activity at least once, but you might try some of the multiple times.

### Design Mashup

1. Pick an object that you like. It can be anything -- a piece of clothing, a digital device, an animal or a website.
2. Make a list of qualities of the item you picked. For example, if I was making a list for my Kindle, I might write:
	- durable, feels like it's not going to break
	- simple, not flashy
	- utilitarian, good for reading and not much else
3. Pick one or two qualities and think about how the site you're redesigning might function if you focused on that quality. For example, I might take a site with lots of animation and images and make it "simple, not flashy" by reducing it to only the text that is absolutely necessary.
4. Sketch out a new version of the site.

### Complete Flip

1. Ask yourself what is made most important by the design of the current site. For example, a personal site might make a description of you most prominent.
2. Pick another aspect of the site and think about what would happen if you made that most prominent. For example, I might decide to make my contact information the most prominent thing.
3. Sketch out a new version of the site.
