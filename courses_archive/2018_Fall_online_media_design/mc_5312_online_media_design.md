This course introduces students to web design and development. In addition to gaining skills in HTML and CSS, students will learn principles of user-centered design and user research and will think about web design and development in the context of social issues such as access and diversity.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- design and develop projects in HTML and CSS, as well as using current frameworks and content management systems.
- critique examples of online storytelling.
- conduct user research.
- produce online, multimedia packages.

### Course Organization

This course involves learning technical skills and also developing ways of thinking about web design and publishing. Classes will be split between workshop time -- when we learn by doing and work together to create web projects -- and discussions of readings and relevant topics. While the course requires minimal reading, you should expect to spend several hours each working on projects and completing other assignments.

### Getting Help

Many resources are available to you online, and we'll talk in class about how to find good resources. Additional assistance is available during designated times in the Media Innovation Lab. You can also come to my office hours or email me.

If you have questions that might be of interest to everyone or want to discuss anything related to class, post them to the #questions channel on  [Slack](https://mc5312fall2018.slack.com).

### Extra Credit

Based on class voting, I'll add one point to the final grade of the student who has the best pitch day presentation.

### Late Work

Unless you have received an extension, assignments turned in late will have five points deducted per day. Work turned in over five days late will not be graded.

### Communication

You must use an active Texas State email account. Communication via TRACS uses your Texas State email, and the university is required to send grade information out only through the Texas State email system. Make sure you check your email on a regular basis, as schedule changes will be communicated there as well as on TRACS.

### Academic Honesty

The School of Journalism and Mass Communication takes your graduate education seriously. Therefore, to do this class properly, the School demands the highest standard of academic honesty and integrity from you. Violations of academic honesty, including but not limited to colluding with other students (without permission) on assignments or exams, can lead to severe penalties. Disciplinary actions are outlined in the Texas State Academic Honesty Statement, which can be found in the [Texas State University student handbook](http://www.dos.txstate.edu/handbook.html).

### Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability certified by the Texas State University Office of Disability Services, and you require accommodations for that disability in class, please tell me early in the semester so that I can accommodate you properly.
