### Goals

1. Practice breaking down large stock on the table saw.
2. Practice dado cuts on the table saw.

### Outcome

This came out almost exactly how I wanted it to. The dado cuts on the table saw aren't as consistent as they could be, and I made a dumb measuring error that changed the design a little. Overall, it's pretty stable for the shape.

### Things that went well

- Ripping the boards into strips went very well.
- Glue-up was much easier with this style of construction.

### Things that didn't go well

- I like how the knots look, but they really weaken thin strips like these.
- The span of the shelves is probably a little too long for thin strips.
- I wish I had planned a little better and put the struts on the inside.
- The dados are inconsistent. I think I could have improved this a little by cutting them before turning the board into strips.

### Reflections

Unfinished pine works fine for projects like this, and I like the look of the strips. Might be fun to work on a much larger shelf in this style.
