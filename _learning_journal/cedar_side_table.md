### Goals

1. Practice making jigs for tapered cuts on the table saw.
2. Practice a new way of joining table tops.
3. Practice a new scarf joint.
4. Experiment with using cedar.

### Outcome

The table actually came out similar to what I was planning. The tapered legs came out decently; I need a different kind of clamp if I want to taper all four sides.

The scarf joints in the middle of the legs came out awful. I don't even think there's a name for what I did. The cedar tore and splintered a lot for these cuts, and I couldn't keep everything square when making my table saw passes. I painted the top portion of the legs to hide some of the blemishes. I had previously planned to stain each legs section differently.

The poplar top looks really good. The mitered trim isn't great, but floating the top in the trim grooves worked fine. However, I don't think the floating would actually do anything for expansion, considering I glued the whole thing down.

Structurally, the table feels pretty good. Assembly was a lot easier with the grooved joints.

### Things that went well

- I'm getting better ripping on the table saw; the whole table is one 2x4.
- I'm happy with the design and the structure.
- I'm getting better at sanding and finishing.

### Things that didn't go well

- I'll never use cedar for this kind of furniture again. It gets marked too easily and finishes really poorly.
- I need to learn some more joints and stop pushing the table saw to do things it can't do well.
- I need to learn some alternatives to miter joints.
- I need to do a better job of looking at similar designs before I start working.

### Reflections

I enjoy improvising and figuring out measurements as I go (instead of using Sketchup, for example). I'd like to go back and read *A Timeless Way of Building* or similar to see what's been said about similar processes.

I probably need to spend some time just practicing joints and stop building finished pieces for a while.

My office walls really need to be painted.
