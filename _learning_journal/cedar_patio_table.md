### Goals

2. Experiment  with slat-based design.
3. Experiment with improvisation while constructing.

### Outcome

The idea for this table was based on George Nelson's slat bench. I started with a very rough plan - I wanted to complete the construction without measurements, and this worked fairly well. The only real downside to designing on the fly like this was that the slats and the base aren't perfectly centered, although that could have ben fixed with slightly better dado cuts and a little more time taken during glue up. The table is stable, and the polyurethane finish on the top looks good.

### Things that went well

- Cutting the dados with the router went very well.
- I enjoyed the process of designing and measuring as I went.
- Cutting and finishing the cedar went better than with previous projects.

### Things that didn't go well

- The slats aren't perfectly spaced, and I'd like to work on this in the future.
- The groove that connects the top with the stand is rounded at the top - I'd like to learn how to cut that groove square.
- I'm slow cutting dados and would like to get faster.

### Reflections

I really like this slab style of furniture and would like to learn a little more about its history. I should get a book on modernist woodworking or furniture design.
